# Dissertation_Code
This repository is where I have stored the files for my master's dissertation project. 
The purpose of the 'Wrangling Data.py' script is to pull data from a text file which has been exported from Web of Science, extract the abstracts and then run frequency analysis on the words that appear in those abstracts. 
The 'article batch file.txt' file is the file exported from a search query from Web of Science based on my current project.
